                <p>The races of Ansalon are generally isolated during the Age
                    of Despair and rarely interact. Suspicion and prejudice
                    run rampant through each race and culture. Old alliances
                    and friendships are only a memory. Elves have withdrawn
                    into their respective lands and severed contact with the
                    outside world. The mountain dwarves of Thorbardin
                    sealed the underground kingdom, abandoning their hill
                    dwarf cousins. Human countries, cities, and towns are
                    insular and distrust outsiders. Minotaur keep to the newly
                    formed islands of Mithas and Kothas, establishing their
                    own kingdom. Ogres celebrate the chaos and lawlessness
                    brought on by the Cataclysm by raiding and conquering
                    their neighbors. The gnomes continue their single-minded
                    pursuit of technological perfection in Mount Nevermind.
                    Kender now enjoy a world full of new places to explore.
                    The Age of Despair is a dark age for Ansalon, a time
                    of fear and suffering. But these hard times will forge the
                    strength the people will need to survive the War of the
                    Lance and beyond.

                <h3>Humans</h3>
                <p>Early in the Age of Despair the humans of Ansalon
                    abandoned all faith. The majority of humans felt betrayed
                    by the disappearance of the gods, and many denounced
                    the gods.
                </p>
                <p>With their relatively short life spans, the humans
                    soon forgot about the true gods, regarding them, as the
                    centuries passed, as little more than myth and legend.
                    The tales of the ancient deities are still passed down from
                    one generation to the next, but, after nearly three and
                    a half centuries they are considered kender tales. Gods
                    are believed to be as real as dragons, fairy folk, and other
                    childhood fantasies.
                </p>
                <p>Generations without faith have led to a longing for
                    some type of belief, and many humans turned to cult
                    worship. False religions and the worship of idols has
                    grown increasingly prevalent. Sometimes these religious
                    movements last for decades before they are finally exposed
                    as frauds. Although most humans no longer believe in the
                    ancient gods, many still hunger for guidance in their lives
                    and seek the solace of a higher being.
                </p>
                <p>True healing has always been considered one of the
                    gods' great powers. When the gods left the world, famine
                    and plague spread throughout the continent. Thousands
                    died in the wake of the gods' departure and, without
                    the aid of the gods' healing powers, the suffering was
                    catastrophic. Many people look for magical healing as a
                    sign of a new, true faith. Many humans try to replicate
                    healing with medicinal herbs and - in some cases - sleight-
                    of-hand. These attempts at healing have never
                    achieved miraculaous results, though local medicine men
                    and shamans use them to assist the people in a world
                    bereft of healing.
                </p>
                <p>The loss of the gods also marked a significant decline in
                    civilized society. Many human communities disappeared,
                    swallowed up by stronger nations. Lawlessness becomes
                    the norm. The Knights of Solamnia, longtime champions
                    of law and righteousness, are a common target of ridicule
                    and scorn because of their inability to prevent the
                    spreading chaos. Their lord cities fall into disrepair and
                    anarchy. It takes decades for such communities to recover
                    from the disaster of the Cataclysm and to begin to forge
                    limited trading routes across an unmapped land. Other than
                    the haphazard wanderings of kender, humans are the
                    primary explorers of post-Cataclysm Ansalon. Yet even the
                    bravest humans rarely range far from home. Many of the
                    routes are dangerous to travel due as much to changes in
                    the landscape, as bandits and other creatures even more
                    evil.

                    <h5>Nomads</h5>
                    <p>The nomadic people of Ansalon have always felt a deep
                        connection with nature. The destruction wrought by the
                        Cataclysm confused and frightened them. To the wandering
                        peoples of Ansalon, who live daily by following the
                        changes of season and the migration of beasts, the physical
                        changes in the world proved devastating. Many urban
                        communities saw their nomadic neighbors as easy prey and
                        attacked them. Such actions served to heighten the
                        suspicion and distrust between nomads and city dwellers.
                        Over the generations, the nomads were able to
                        establish fresh hunting grounds and track the new
                        migrations of animals, their lives improved. Lacking the
                        uniting force of the gods, however, many tribes splintered,
                        while others waited patiently and chose to accept the gods'
                        silence as the supreme test of their devotion.
                        Of the tribes that remained intact, most worshipped
                        deities of their own invention modeled after familiar
                        aspects of the true gods. The gods of these nomads had
                        their own names and identities. Worship of the gods of
                        townsfolk was expressly forbidden. The nomad tribes
                        highly venerated the spirits of their ancestors who had
                        gone before them, and eventually, the worship of ancestors
                        became a dominant form of religion. The absence of the
                        true gods was not nearly as difficult for some nomads
                        to accept, as many tribes had always maintained religious
                        rituals and ceremonies that honored all the spirits.

                    <h5>Townsfolk</h5>
                    <p>City life during the Age of Despair was chaotic. The
                        Cataclysm flooded entire nations and landlocked others,
                        destroying the trade routes for nearly every major city of
                        Ansalon. Changes in the climate ravaged crops. What little
                        food could be salvaged or grown - if it wasn't stolen - was
                        hoarded. The meager amount of food that could be
                        delivered to the cities was bought up by wealthy clientele
                        for outrageous prices, leaving the poor to beg or filch
                        whatever they could find.
                        Without healers, disease ran rampant and plague
                        spread like wildfire. Most citizens lived in squalor,
                        cowering amidst the ruins of buildings or hunkered
                        down in wooden shacks. Over the course of centuries, the
                        situation has gradually improved, but while some cities
                        have prospered, others remain locked in despair, filth, and
                        poverty.

                <h3>Dwarves</h3>
                <p>While the human nations of Ansalon suffered terribly,
                    perhaps no other race was affected by the Cataclysm as
                    much as the dwarves. The Fall of Istar separated one
                    dwarven realm from another and ignited a civil war that
                    killed thousands. In Kayolin, the creation of the New Sea
                    separated the northern clans of the Hylar and Daewar
                    from their brethren in the south, leaving the dwarves
                    there to rebuild without assistance from the kingdom of
                    Thorbardin. They eventually renamed the mountains the
                    Garnet Mountain range, and severed ties to their kindred
                    of the south.
                </p>
                <p>In the Kharolis Mountains, the dwarves fell into a
                    bloody feud when fear of invasion and starvation forced
                    the mountain dwarves to close their doors to the outside
                    world-which also meant shutting out the hill dwarves
                    who wanted entry for access to the valuable food stores
                    located deep beneath the mountains. The escalating
                    dispute turned dwarf against dwarf, and hundreds of
                    dwarves died on both sides of the conflict.
                </p>
                <p>The most damage was inflicted on the kingdom of
                    Thoradin. Thousands of dwarves were crushed to death
                    when the continent was violently reshaped into new forms.
                    Earthquakes, eruptions, and other disasters swept the
                    underground nation, leaving only one city intact. The city
                    of the Theiwar survived, but a horrible mold plague took
                    root in their city, altering every Theiwar citizen until the
                    dwarves looked unlike any known to Ansalon. Insatiably
                    evil, this race survived and crawled from the ashes.
                </p>
                <section>
                    <h5>Hill Dwarves (The Neidar)</h5>
                    <p>The Neidar lost much more than the mountain dwarves
                        in the aftermath of the Cataclysm. Their population went
                        into decline following years of famine. Thousands more
                        died during "the Betrayal" (the hill dwarves' term for the
                        Dwarfgate War). After the war, the dwarves picked up the
                        pieces of their lives and forged a new existence. With most
                        of their warriors dead, many women and children of the
                        hill dwarf villages had to take up arms against bandits,
                        rampaging ogres, hordes of goblins and mercenaries who
                        swept through the lowlands looking for easy pickings.
                        What the invaders discovered, however, was that, unlike
                        humans, all dwarves are raised with martial training. With
                        each encounter, the dwarves prevailed and over a century
                        the attacks slowed.
                    </p>
                    <p>By the second century following the Cataclysm, a
                        number of settlements for trade were reestablished across
                        the mountains. The hill dwarves patrolled the new trade
                        routes and prospered. Although their numbers were small,
                        they grew as many of the sturdy dwarven women had
                        multiple children. Large families of hill dwarves lived in
                        each settlement. Each child was given training in how to
                        wield a sword or axe, and daily they were reminded of
                        the treachery of their kin under the mountain. It was the
                        mountain dwarves' fault their father or grandfather had
                        perished. It was a terrible act of treachery that would never
                        be forgotten.
                    </p>
                    <p>The silence of the gods was yet another hardship the
                        Neidar had to endure, along with the rest of the world.
                        Too busy dealing with their troubles, the worship of many
                        of the gods was abandoned. The stories and teachings of
                        the gods were handed down from one dwarf to the next,
                        but only as lessons or parables. A handful of churches
                        were built to honor the ancient gods, but these were often
                        manned by only one or two dwarves. Gatherings at the
                        churches were often only performed during dwarven holidays
                        - both religious and secular. Currently, traditions are
                        upheld, but the heart of the hill dwarf religion is hollow.

                    continent as the kender race. Prior to the Cataclysm, the
                    kender of Ansalon had their fair share of problems with
                    Istar. In 118 PC the Proclamation of Manifest Virtue was
                    issued, stating that kender were inherently evil. By 115
                    PC an army of Solamnia was arrayed along the borders of
                    Kenderhome, though the army never invaded. Many songs
                    and stories tell of these times and how the knights and
                    kender would gather along the borders during holidays
                    and get drunk and laugh about the official nonsense being
                    issued from Istar. Repeated commands from Istar were
                    ignored, as no high-ranking member of Solamnia felt that
                    kender were inherently evil. The largest border conflict
                    occurred in 83 PC when an Istarian priest convinced
                    a division commander to strike directly at Hylo. It was
                    a bloody battle, but the kender ended up winning and
                    captured the Istarian priest. He was locked away in a
                    tower until 70 PC when the Solamnic High Justice managed
                    to negotiate his release. From that time forward kender
                    were forbidden to set foot in Istar.
                </p>
                <p>The laws regarding kender only made it that much
                    harder for the kender of Balifor to resist seeing what all
                    the fuss was about in Istar. Before too long, Istar had
                    sanctioned the extermination of evil races and kender
                    were among those listed. At 30 gold a topknot, the kender
                    were a popular bounty. But most bounty hunters found
                    kender difficult to handle and preferred to take them dead,
                    rather than alive, back to Istar. These new laws solidified
                    relationships between previously hostile races. Goblins of
                    the northern wastes and the kender of Bailfor formed a
                    truce to protect each other when bounty hunters or patrols
                    of Istarian soldiers traveled through their region. As brute
                    squads intensified, the kender retreated farther into their
                    forests and the goblins disappeared into the wastelands.
                    When the day of reckoning came, except for the human nations
                    of Ergoth and Istar, Hylo and Balifor suffered
                    the worst of the destruction. Hundreds of miles of forest
                    dropped below sea level and were flooded. The horror of
                    the devastation marked many kender, causing them to take
                    a more serious view of life, though none ever completely
                    lost their cheerful optimism.
                </p>
                <p>The city of Hylo became overcrowded and disease ran
                    rampant. It took many years for them to overcome their
                    desolate situation. In Goodlund the displaced kender
                    became barbaric and traveled across the desert regions of
                    the north.
                </p>
                <p>After three to four generations, the kender settled new
                    villages and cities in Hylo and the peninsula of Goodlund
                    and continued their lives of exploring the world around
                    them. With the coming of the dragonarmies, many kender
                    have taken to the road to investigate rumors and see if
                    there is anything interesting to be found.

                <h3>Half-Elf</h3>
                <p>Half-elves have always been regarded with prejudice and
                    distrust by both parent races. The Age of Despair has only
                    amplified these problems, leading to abandoned, neglected,
                    or abused half-elf children. The racial prejudice in the
                    early Age of Despair forced many half-elves to attempt to
                    hide their heritage from the world. Many lost their lives
                    because they couldn't disguise their elven looks. Others
                    learned to move about inconspicuously, and avoid places
                    where humans congregate.
                </p>
                <p>In the elven lands, half-elves found no sanctuary.
                    Scorned for their human parentage, any half-Silvanesti
                    was cast out as a mongrel. In Qualinesti half-elves were
                    tolerated at best, but never fully accepted by polite society.
                    Seen in public, they were often singled out for snide or
                    condescending comment, and pointedly reminded of the
                    perceived failing they were unable to remedy.
                    Many half-elves joined cults or religious groups seeking
                    fellowship. Others formed bandit gangs, honing their
                    skills with blades or bows in various shady enterprises.
                    Their natural cunning and grace made them exceptional
                    leaders, and they gained the respect of not only their
                    followers but the humans and elves who had previously
                    misjudged them.

                <h3>Elves</h3>
                <p>The elves of Ansalon, with lifetimes measured in centuries,
                    have long witnessed the destruction and rebirth of the
                    lands around them. Even they were appalled by the
                    devastation caused by the Cataclysm. The loss of the
                    gods has been especially demoralizing and marked
                    the beginning of a downward spiral in elven society.
                    Elves place full blame for the Cataclysm on the human
                    Kingpriest and his foolish actions, even though they
                    supported his crusade for good. The elves turned their
                    backs on humanity and isolated themselves.
                </p>
                <p>The elves harbor deep resentment toward the rest
                    of the world for the loss of their beloved gods. They live
                    apart, trying to avoid the famine, disease, and banditry
                    that still occasionally invade their sylvan sanctuaries. The
                    elves have reinforced their borders against human, goblin,
                    and ogre raiders. They remember the gods of old, but no
                    longer worship them, angered that the divine forces of
                    good would abandon their chosen people.

                    <h5>Qualinesti</h5>
                    <p>The elves of Qualinesti struggled to survive during the
                        tumultuous first years after the Cataclysm, battling hordes
                        of rampaging goblin tribes that penetrated Abanasinia
                        and human mercenary raiders who were convinced that
                        the elves were hiding great riches within the forest. The
                        Qualinesti worked tirelessly to preserve their way of life,
                        and in many ways they succeeded-though spiritually
                        they were empty, bereft of the gods of good who had once
                        watched over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>The situation grew worse. Human warlords invaded
                        the region and tested the resolve of the Qualinesti nation.
                        Bloody clashes increased the hostility between the races.
                        Yet the Qualinesti borders remained intact. The human
                        marauders settled in the north and south of the elven
                        nation. The Kharolis Mountains that border the elven
                        lands on the west prevented any invasion through the
                        territory of the hill dwarves. Thus the elves' isolation grew
                        over the centuries until an elf was rarely seen outside their
                        own lands.
